#Python Electricity Compansation Equipment Optimiser Program:  
Python Electricity Compensation Equipment Optimiser aims to create a reactor, MCR, or capacitor usage decision optimization. In this application, the user can see how many times a reactor or capacitor must be on or off state in a month hourly bases in order to meet the targets of legal reactive levels. The application uses historical data for the calculation of on/off states. The algorithm of the application also promises for online compensation equipment control mechanisms.
